Segmentation type: asyll
Nucleus: 38 nuclei in signal

 WARNING: The global measures below are only meaningful for speech samples of at least 100 nuclei (syllables).


Pitch range of speaker(s): (based on 2 stylization values per nucleus)
     Speaker label: Range, Bottom, Mean, Median, Top, MeanOfST, StdevOfST
     ANON         : 16.6ST, 92Hz (78.3ST), 183Hz (90.2ST), 186Hz (90.5ST), 240Hz (94.9ST), 89.8ST, 4.0ST

Pitch range of speaker(s): (based on 2 raw F0 values per nucleus)
     Speaker label: P02, Mean, Median, P98
     ANON         : 92Hz, 183Hz, 186Hz, 240Hz

Pitch variability of speaker(s):
     Speaker label: TrajIntra, TrajInter, TrajPhon, TrajIntraZ, TrajInterZ, TrajPhonZ, PropLevel, Gliss, Rises, Falls
     ANON         : 2.9 ST/s, 15.4 ST/s, 9.1 ST/s, 0.7 sd/s, 3.8 sd/s, 2.3 sd/s, 84.2%, 2.6%, 0%, 2.6% 

Temporal profile of speaker(s):
     Speaker label: SpeechRate, TotalDur, %Phonation, %Pauses, PhonTime, NuclDur, InterNuclDur, PauseDur
     ANON         : 4.40 syll/s, 332.760 s, 99.8%, 0.2%, 332.000 s, 92.000 s, 240.000 s, 0.76 s 

Duration variability of speaker(s):
     Speaker label: NuclDurMean, NuclDurStdev, nPVI_nucldur, nPVI_voweldur, nPVI_sylldur
     ANON         : 0.115 s, 0.081, 70.05, 0, 0 


TotalDur   = total speech time (in s) = internucleus time + intranucleus time + pause time
PhonTime   = phonation time (in s) = without pauses = internucleus time + intranucleus time
%Phonation = proportion (%) of estimated phonation time (= internucleus time + intranucleus time) to speech time
%Pauses    = proportion (%) of estimated pause time (= when internucleus time >= 0.3) to speech time
SpeechRate = estimated speech rate (in syll/s) = nrof_nuclei/phonation_time
MeanOfST   = mean of pitch values, where values are min and max pitch in ST for each syllable
StdevOfST  = stdev of pitch values, where values are min and max pitch in ST for each syllable
PitchRange = estimated pitch range (in ST) (2%-98% percentiles of data in nuclei without discontinuities)
Gliss      = proportion (%) of syllables with large pitch movement (abs(distance) >= 4ST)
Rises      = proportion (%) of syllables with pitch rise (>= 4ST)
Falls      = proportion (%) of syllables with pitch fall (<= -4ST)
NuclDur    = sum of durations for nuclei for this speaker
InterNuclDur = sum of durations between successive nuclei for this speaker
TrajIntra  = pitch trajectory (sum of absolute intervals) within syllabic nuclei, divided by duration (in ST/s)
TrajInter  = pitch trajectory (sum of absolute intervals) between syllabic nuclei (except pauses or speaker turns), divided by duration (in ST/s)
TrajPhon   = sum of TrajIntra and TrajInter, divided by phonation time (in ST/s)
TrajIntraZ = as TrajIntra, but for pitch trajectory in standard deviation units on ST scale (z-score) (in sd/s)
TrajInterZ = as TrajInter, but for pitch trajectory in standard deviation units on ST scale (z-score) (in sd/s)
TrajPhonZ  = as TrajPhon,  but for pitch trajectory in standard deviation units on ST scale (z-score) (in sd/s)
